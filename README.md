# Molecolab (c) 2024 ecopals GmbH
An automated virtual laboratory to predict structure-property relationship. 

This molecular dynamics simulation lab runs on 3 mouse clicks: 
1. Build and mix materials (complex materials, polymers, additives, etc.).
2. Simulate and compute rheological and physicochemical properties.
3. Visualize and validate.
